# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
Module 7
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to use SQL queries to determine the number of retiring employees at Pewlett Hackard, organized by title, and identify PH employees who are eligible for a new mentorship program. We completed this analysis using pgAdmin 4, by writing SQL queries, organizing the data into tables, and exporting our results.

## Results
After creating an ERD to help connect the different CSV files and define the relationships, we conducted our analysis using SQL. Here are four major conclusions we found after completing the analysis:


1.There are 300,024 employees at Pewlett Hackard. After conducting our analysis, we found that 72,458 employees were of retiring age. That is about 24% of employees, which is a huge part of their workforce. They must focus on hiring replacements ASAP.

2.After looking at the number of retiring employees, we dug deeper into their specific titles. 70% of the retiring employees had 'Senior' in their title, meaning PH will have to recruit new leadership.
